  currency_description: 'A side-project with the goal to create a product that does one job incredibly well and learn a new programming language along the way.

  currency_intro_1: 'After having used various currency converter applications that are available on the App Store either free or paid, I found that these were either too complex, unintuitive, or yet to be updated to new iPhone screen sizes. Very often these apps have walkthroughs to explain the complex interactions, navigation or features they can provide to the user, instead of being simple to use.'
  currency_intro_3: 'I designed Currency to be the simplest and most intuitive currency converter in the App Store, that would look perfect on any iPhone screen.'
