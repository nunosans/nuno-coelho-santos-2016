        <a href="http://thread.com/" target="_blank">Thread</a> is an online
        styling service, currently only for men in the UK, that joins the
        world’s best fashion stylists and Artificial Intelligence in a single
        platform to give users personal styling for free. Thread is a
        <a href="" target="_blank">YC’11</a> start-up founded by
        <a href="" target="_blank">Kieran O’Neill</a>,
        <a href="" target="_blank">Benjamin Phillips</a> and
        <a href="" target="_blank">Ben Kucsan</a>. I joined the team in 2014 as
        a product designer and worked with the smartest team I’ve worked with so
        far (<a href="" target="_blank">Alinna Chung</a>,

        At Thread, we defined the long term vision for the company and broke it
        down into product, operations, styling and marketing goals. While I was
        part of the Thread product team, I would take on one of these challenge
        every week and set it as a weekly goal.
      </p>
      <p>
        A typical week at Thread would include brainstorming and sketching on
        Monday, visual design and critics on Tuesday, prototyping and testing on
        Wednesday, development and testing on Thursday and Friday. Every Friday
        we would demo the work done and some of these solutions would be shipped
        on Monday the following week.

      <p>
        Most Thread users visit Thread from their mobile devices, however
        internally we would always focus on the desktop design first because
        that’s where most orders were placed. How could we make the mobile
        experience the defining experience of the platform?
      </p>
      <p>
        We started by tackling this challenge by designing a native iOS
        experience of Thread and testing it with users. The prototype aims to
        replicate the native iOS feel as much as possible. The user’s feedback
        was positive and the team felt that a native app is the best way to
        experience Thread.

        Moving our product from being a website to a native application, done
        properly, required more planning. So we tried a different approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        We developed a new design system for Thread called Thread Whitechapel.
        This design system included new type styles, new touch interactions,
        new guidelines for flows and page content, and a new set of standard
        HTML components. This resulted not only in a better mobile experience,
        but it also allowed us to design and develop faster while keeping our
        visual language consistent.

      <p>
        Thread has a powerful recommendation engine that helps match the outfits
        each stylist makes to each client preferences, but when the stylists are
        away we can’t generate these recommendations for the users. So how
        should Thread work when this is the case?
      </p>
      <p>
        At the time, stylists could use the Thread engine to find clothing items
        and users could receive recommendations from stylists. But a channel
        between the user and the Thread engine was missing. During the first
        week, myself and Dan Palmer explored how an experience of using Thread’s
        engine without having the stylist involved would look like to users.

        We developed the concept of a curated store. Imagine a clothing line,
        made of the amount of items a person can realistically own. A curated
        wardrobe. We wanted an experience similar to walking to a clothing store
        and seeing only new items that you would love. This became Thread
        Browse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thread has thousands of items and there are thousands of online stores
        with thousands of items that are irrelevant to their users. Thread
        Browse is the curated shopping experience for when your personal
        stylist isn’t available. Designs show the items categorised by outer to
        inner-most clothing, and a limited number of results is displayed below.
        All matching the user preferences.
