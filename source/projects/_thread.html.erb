        <a href="http://thread.com/" target="_blank">Thread</a> is an online
        styling service, currently only for men in the UK, that joins the
        world’s best fashion stylists and Artificial Intelligence in a single
        platform to give users personal styling for free. Thread is a

        I joined the team in 2014 as a product designer and worked alongside

        At Thread, we defined the long term vision for the company and broke it
        down into product, operations, styling and marketing goals. While I was
        part of the Thread product team, I would take on one of these challenge
        every week and set it as a weekly goal.

    <div class="project-item project-thread-week">
      <p>
        A typical week at Thread would include brainstorming and sketching on
        Monday, visual design and critics on Tuesday, prototyping and testing on
        Wednesday, development and testing on Thursday and Friday. Every Friday
        we would demo the work done and some of these solutions would be shipped
        on Monday the following week.

        Thread users visit Thread from their mobile more and more over time
        devices, however internally we always had the habit of designing
        thinking on the desktop browser first. So in this project we looked
        at what the ideal mobile experience would be like and how we could
        reshape our design and development process to fit a mobile-first
        approach.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="project-item project-thread-mobile-intro-part-2">
      <p>
        We started by tackling this challenge by designing a native iOS
        experience of Thread. We built a wireframe prototype and  asked users
        to visit our office to use it. After a few interviews, everyone in the
        team felt like this was an improvement over the current experience.

      <p>
        We also explored a different direction, that focused on systematizing
        our web experience to be more modular and targeted for mobile browsers.
        We called this new system Thread Whitechapel. It included new type
        styles, new touch interactions, new guidelines for flows and page
        content, and a new set of standard HTML components.<br>
        <br>
        This resulted not only in a better mobile experience, but it also
        allowed us to design and develop faster while keeping our visual
        language consistent.

        Thread has a powerful recommendation engine that helps match the outfits
        each stylist makes to each client preferences, but when the stylists are
        away we can’t generate these recommendations for the users. So how
        should Thread work when this is the case?
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="project-item project-thread-browse-intro-part-2">
      <p>
        At the time, stylists could use the Thread engine to find clothing items
        and users could receive recommendations from stylists. But a channel
        between the user and the Thread engine was missing. During the first
        week, myself and Dan Palmer explored how an experience of using Thread’s
        engine without having the stylist involved would look like to users.

        We developed the concept of a curated store. Imagine a clothing line,
        made of the amount of items a person can realistically own. A curated
        wardrobe. We wanted an experience similar to walking to a clothing store
        and seeing only new items that you would love. This became Thread
        Browse.<br>
        <br>
        Thread has thousands of items and there are thousands of online stores
        with thousands of items that are irrelevant to their users. Thread
        Browse is the curated shopping experience for when your personal
        stylist isn’t available. Designs show the items categorized by outer to
        inner-most clothing, and a limited number of results is displayed below.
        All matching the user preferences.
