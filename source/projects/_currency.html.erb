      <p>
        From using currency converter applications, free or paid, available on
        the App Store I found that these were either unnecessarily complex,
        unintuitive, or haven’t been updated new iPhone screen sizes. Very often
        these apps have a walkthrough to explain the complex interactions or
        features, when I thought they were meant to be simple.
      </p>
      <p>
        I designed Currency to be the simplest and most intuitive currency
        converter in the App Store, that would look perfect on any iPhone
        screen. My target customer is a traveller in a foreign country and the
        target moment is that traveller wanting to know the value of the foreign
        currency in their home currency.

      <button class="button button-play" data-action="play-currency-iphone">
        <span class="icon icon-play"></span>Play
      </button>
      <button class="button button-pause" data-action="pause-currency-iphone" data-layout="hidden">
        <span class="icon icon-pause"></span>Pause
      </button>
      <p>
        The final design focuses on doing one job well: converting a foreign
        currency into the customer’s home currency. Features such as currency
        fluctuation graphs, in-app settings and notifications were not necessary
        for this job.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the most unique aspects of Currency is the formatting of the
        currencies, with the correct symbol, correct number of decimal places,
        decimal divider and group dividers.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="project-item project-currency-app-icon">
      <img
        src="./images/currency-app-icon-2x.png"
        alt=""
        width="126"
        height="126"
      >
      <p>
        The icon is designed to fit perfectly with iOS, presenting Currency as
        if it is part of the operating system.

      <p>
        Most currency apps use country flags to illustrate the different
        currencies. But some currencies like Bitcoin or the Euro don’t belong to
        a specific country. For this reason I instead used currency symbols and
        correct currency formatting, along with currency codes to correctly
        represent the different currencies.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="project-item project-currency-process">

      <p>
        Some early sketches displayed multiple currencies on the main screen and
        used country flags. One of the early designs uses a blue and dark visual
        style that I later on retired. While asking for feedback, friends seemed
        confused about which number they were editing so I added a text input
        blinking cursor.
      </p>
      <p>
        The final design is bright and shows activity indicators when the
        currency exchange rates are being updated. Other settings were added via
        the iOS Settings based on user feedback.

        This was the first app I developed for iOS, and my first time writing
        Swift. Learning how to develop for iOS was a personal goal. I learnt by
        reading Beginning iOS Development in Swift by Apress, by attending
        Command Swift workshops organised by Johnny Linnert, and with some
        help from other friends like Jonathon Toon and Tiago Alves.
