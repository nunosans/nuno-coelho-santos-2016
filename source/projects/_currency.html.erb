        The icon is pure, simple, and follows the unbranded style of the
        product. I wanted Currency to blend into the platfrom as if it was a
        bundled utility.

        In some currencies like the Euro or the Bitcoin, a country flag wouldn’t
        correcly represent the currency. So flags were not included in the
        design and users didn’t raise confusion around this decision. The
        formatting of the currency values with the currency symbol and correct
        use of commas or full stops to divide decimal places was said to be
        useful when reading prices in a foreign country.
