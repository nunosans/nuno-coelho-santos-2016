# Nuno Coelho Santos 2016 Portfolio

![Preview of Nuno Coelho Santos' 2016 Portfolio](http://i.imgur.com/uR6EI42.png)

This is the 2016 version of my portfolio. In 2011, when I designed the current version of my portfolio, the focus was to show a range of work in a design that I would be proud down the line. Both goals were achieved. For the 2016 version I want to show only 3 projects in much more depth than before. This comes naturally as I engage in larger projects in my carrer. I also want a design that stays relevant for my future self in 5 years from now.
